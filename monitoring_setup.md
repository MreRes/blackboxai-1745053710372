# Monitoring and Alerting Setup for WhatsApp Financial Planner Bot

This document outlines steps to set up monitoring and alerting for the WhatsApp bot and backend services.

## 1. Centralized Logging

- Use a log aggregation tool such as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud logging service (e.g., Loggly, Datadog).
- Configure your application logs (currently using pino) to output JSON logs compatible with your chosen logging system.
- Set up log rotation and retention policies to manage disk space.

## 2. Health Checks

- Implement HTTP health check endpoints in your backend and AI server.
- Use tools like Prometheus or Nagios to periodically check service health.
- Configure automatic restarts or alerts on failure.

## 3. Alerting

- Set up alert rules based on log error rates, service downtime, or performance degradation.
- Use email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other channels for notifications.
- Define escalation policies for critical issues.

## 4. Performance Metrics

- Instrument your code to expose metrics such as request latency, error rates, and throughput.
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization.

## 5. Next Steps

- Containerize your services for easier monitoring integration.
- Automate deployment and monitoring configuration with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
